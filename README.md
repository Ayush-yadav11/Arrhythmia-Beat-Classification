# Arrhythmia Beat Classification

This project is an implementation of an arrhythmia beat classification system using the publicly available MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The aim of this project is to classify different types of heartbeats from ECG data using machine learning techniques. We build upon the approach outlined in the article [Combining Low-dimensional Wavelet Features and Support Vector Machine for Arrhythmia Beat Classification](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06596-z).

## Overview

This system can classify five types of heartbeats:

- Normal beat (N)
- Atrial premature beat (A)
- Premature ventricular contraction (V)
- Left bundle branch block beat (L)
- Right bundle branch block beat (R)

Using wavelet transformation and machine learning, we achieve up to 95.50% accuracy in classification.

## Introduction

The detection of heart arrhythmia from ECG signals is a key step in the diagnosis of cardiac disorders. This project focuses on building an automated arrhythmia detection system using a machine learning pipeline to classify different heartbeat types from ECG recordings.

## Dataset

We use the **[MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)**, which has been a standard for arrhythmia research since 1980. The dataset consists of 48 half-hour ECG recordings, with annotations by cardiologists. These recordings include both common and less common arrhythmias, making it suitable for training classification models.

## Method

1. **Beat Segmentation**: The ECG signal is segmented into episodes based on QRS intervals using the R-peak locations provided in the dataset.
2. **Wavelet Decomposition**: Features are extracted using wavelet multi-resolution analysis (WMRA).
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the wavelet features.
4. **Classification**: Three machine learning algorithms are used to classify the heartbeats: **_K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks_**.

## Preprocessing

- **Beat Segmentation**: ECG recordings are segmented into beats using QRS intervals based on R-peak locations provided by MITDB.
- **Feature Extraction**: Wavelet analysis is applied to extract features from each beat. We used **_bior_** wavelet family and specifically the **_bior 6.8_**.
- **Data Normalization**: StandardScaler is used to normalize the data.
  
   Example code:

   ```python
   import qrsintervals
   # Define extraction parameters
   mitdbih_db_path = 'mit-bih-arrhythmia-database-1.0.0'
   annotations = ['A', 'V', 'N', 'L', 'R']
   qrs_interval_length = 320
   qrsintervals.extract_qrs_intervals_and_save(mitdbih_db_path, 'ecg_signals.mat', annotations)
   ...
   # Define the feature extraction parameters
   classes = 'A', 'V', 'N', 'L', 'R'
   signals_per_class = 2546
   wavelet = pywt.Wavelet('bior6.8')
   decomposition_level = 8
   # Extract features
   ext_feat_signals = preprocessing.extract_features
   (
   ECG_signals,         # The ECG signals from the ecg_signals.mat
  classes,             # The classification classes (A, V, N, L, R)
  signals_per_class,   # How many signals per class we have
  wavelet,         # The Wavelet
  decomposition_level  # The decomposition level for the Wavelet decomposition
   )
   ...

   ```

## Feature Extraction

Features are extracted from each ECG signal using **wavelet transformations**. These features are then reduced to a lower-dimensional representation using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.

## Classification

We apply three machine learning algorithms for heartbeat classification:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Neural Networks**

Metrics used for comparison:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

## Results

The table below summarizes the performance of each classifier on the test data:

| Algorithm             | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| **Nearest Neighbors** | 88.71%   | 88.77%    | 88.71% | 88.63%   |
| **Linear SVM**        | 92.41%   | 92.32%    | 92.41% | 92.34%   |
| **RBF SVM**           | 83.50%   | 87.50%    | 83.50% | 84.17%   |
| **Neural Net**        | 95.50%   | 95.48%    | 95.50% | 95.46%   |
